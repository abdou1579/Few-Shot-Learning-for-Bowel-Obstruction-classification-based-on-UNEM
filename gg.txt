some sketching 

We have extracted feautres, so no need to use the feature extractor model, this we should perform the evaluation directly and the support and query sets



        all_features_support = extracted_features_dic_support['concat_features']
        all_labels_support = extracted_features_dic_support['concat_labels'].long()
        all_features_query = extracted_features_dic_query['concat_features']
        all_labels_query = extracted_features_dic_query['concat_labels'].long()


we were provided two datasets, of two different feature extractors, thus we have to choose our own support and query sets to evaluate a model

for shot in shots:
    Categorical_Sampler 'for Labels'
    sampler_support = SamplerSupport(sampler)
    sampler_query = SamplerQuery(sampler)

    task_generator = Tasks_Generator(k_eff=self.args.k_eff, n_ways=self.args.n_ways, shot=shot, n_query=self.args.n_query, loader_support=test_loader_support, loader_query=test_loader_query,    train_mean=train_mean, log_file=self.log_file) 'meaning we prepare the proper datasets k-way n-shots  for both support and query sets'

    here the bullshit starts we choose which method we going to use in our proejct its U-PADDLE
