##  Introduction
This repository contains the code for our paper "UNEM: UNrolled Generalized EM for Transductive Few-Shot Learning".

Usage instructions for Visual only methods (Tables 1-2) are located in the [EM-Gaussian folder](UNEM_Gaussian/).

Usage instructions for VLM methods (Table 3) are located in the [EM-Dirichlet folder](UNEM_Dirichlet/).
